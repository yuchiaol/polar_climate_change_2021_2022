    "\n",
    "- Near-surface of the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes are warming at rates double that of lower latitudes (Cohen et al., 2014).\n",

    "## Quantitative definition of AA\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arctic amplification factor (AAF): Arctic surface air temperature change divided by global surface air temperature change.\n",
    "- Arctic amplification efficacy (AAE): AAF$_{XX}$ divided by AAF$_{CO_2}$, where $XX$ is the forcing agent.\n",
