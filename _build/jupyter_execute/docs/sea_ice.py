# Sea Ice

## What is sea ice?

- Sea ice is formed in the salty ocean water (-1.8°C)
- Sea ice appears in Arctic and Antarctica. Sea ice can form in Bohai Bay.
- Sea ice covers about 25 million square km of the Earth’s surface (about 2.5 times the area of Canada, or 15% of world’s ocean).

## Classification of Sea Ice

- By age: first-year v.s. multi-year
- New ice: < 10 cm thick
- Young ice: 10-30 cm
  - grey ice: 10-15 cm
  - grey-white ice: 15-30 cm
- First-year ice: > 30 cm, but melt out in melting season (summer)
- Multi-year ice: 2-4 m, survived melting season

## Sea Ice Formation

- Phase diagram of salt water
- Ice growth process
  - Rough ocean: pancake ice -> rafting or ridging -> cementing or consolidation -> sheet ice 
  - Calm ocean: grease ice -> nilas -> rafting -> congelation ice -> sheet ice
- Salinity and brine
- The role of waves

## Multi-year Sea Ice

- Freshwater supplies for polar expeditions.
- Multi-year ice has different electromagnetic properties from first-year ice, so that satellite sensors can distinguish them.
- More multi-year ice in Arctic than in Antarctica.

## Sea Ice Features

- Sea ice and melting ponds
- Pancake ice
- Ridged sea ice
- Leads
- Polynyas
- Sea ice and oceanic mesoscale eddies
- Lake ice

## Sea Ice Thermodynamics

- Freezing degree days (FDD in deg C).
- Thickness (cm) = 1.33xFDD^0.58 (Lebedev 1938).
- Snow cover slows the growth of ice.
- Albedo effect (melting pond -> 0.4-0.5 and surface 0.75).
- Thermodynamic equilibrium thickness (no heat transfer): 3 meters in Arctic; 1-2 meters in Antarctica. 

## Sea Ice Dynamics

- Dynamics does not direct contribute to sea ice formation or reduction.
- Winds
  - generally sea ice that drifts freely moves at 2 percent of the wind speed
  - sea ice surface roughness (angle).
  - 20-40 degrees to the right in Northern Hemisphere.
- Ocean currents
- Coriolis force
- Internal ice stress
- Sea surface tilt

## Sea-ice Impacts on Earth System

- Albedo feedback
- Atmospheric heat transport
- Thermohaline circulation
  - Greenland melting
  - sea ice (brine effect)
- Rivers (10% of world’s river discharge)
- Sea-ice movements
- Heat exchange
