## Course Description

(in Chinese) 本課程探討極區的氣候變化。我們不僅介紹極區冰圈以及大氣圈過去幾十年的快速變化，包括海冰，永凍土，降雪，冰河，極地渦旋，也會介紹北極暖化增強現象的成因與影響，以及探討高緯度氣候變化與中低緯度大氣海洋環流的交互作用。我們會閱讀IPCC最新關於冰圈的特別報告以及最新的研究文獻，來幫助我們掌握極區最新的研究成果與發展趨勢，同時也會使用不同複雜度的大氣模式，來加深了解極區與中低緯度大氣環流交互作用背後的物理動力機制。

Rapid polar climate change in the past decades was the dominant signature of anthropogenic global warming. This course aims to understand the polar climate change and its interaction with regional and global atmospheric circulations. The first part gives an overview of the fast-changing polar cryosphere and atmosphere, including sea ice, permafrost, snow, glaciers, and stratospheric polar vortex. Students will read IPCC’s Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate and present main conclusions. The second part discusses the two-way interactions of the polar climate change and lower-latitude (including mid-latitude and tropical) atmospheric and oceanic circulations at various spatial and temporal scales, with an emphasis on the cause and effect of Arctic Amplification. We will use a hierarchical modelling approach with different complexity in attempt to understand the potential atmospheric circulation changes in response to polar warming. The anticipated results will be compared to the observations and the state-of-the-art global climate model simulations, for example CMIP5/6 and Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project.

## Course Objective
This course aims to 1) understand the polar climate change and its interaction with regional and global atmospheric circulations, 2) cover some materials of Chapter 12 - Middle Atmosphere Dynamics - in Holton’s “An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology”, and 3) train students to use simple atmospheric model to investigate Arctic-midlatitude connections. 

## Course Requirement
Willingness to lead discussion for reading materials and participate in group cooperation, and basic FORTRAN programing and plotting skills (Python preferred because we will use a machine learning package written in Python!).

[Python](https://www.python.org) is a general-purpose programming
language conceived in 1989 by Dutch programmer [Guido van
Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).

Python is free and open source, with development coordinated through the
[Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).

Python has experienced rapid adoption in the last decade and is now one
of the most commonly used programming languages.

Popular textbooks on Python programming include {cite}`guttag2016introduction` and {cite}`hill2016learning`.

### Common Uses

Python is a general-purpose language used in almost all application domains
such as

-   communications
-   web development
-   CGI and graphical user interfaces
-   game development
-   multimedia, data processing, security, etc., etc., etc.

Python is beginner-friendly and routinely used to teach computer science and
programming in top computer science programs.

Python is particularly popular within the scientific and data science
communities.

It is steadily [replacing familiar tools like
Excel](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/us-en/3002556/python-replaced-excel-banking)
in the fields of finance and banking.

### Relative Popularity

The following chart, produced using Stack Overflow Trends, shows one
measure of the relative popularity of Python

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/about_py/python_vs_matlab.png
:scale: 72%
```

The figure indicates not only that Python is widely used but also that
adoption of Python has accelerated significantly since 2012.

This is driven at least in part by uptake in the scientific
domain, particularly in rapidly growing fields like data science.

For example, the popularity of [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), a
library for data analysis with Python has exploded, as seen here.

(The corresponding time path for MATLAB is shown for comparison)

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/about_py/pandas_vs_matlab.png
:scale: 23%
```

Note that pandas takes off in 2012, which is the same year that we see
Python\'s popularity begin to spike in the first figure.

Overall, it\'s clear that

-   Python is [one of the most popular programming languages worldwide](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages).
-   Python is a major tool for scientific computing, accounting for a
    rapidly rising share of scientific work around the globe.

### Features

Python is a [high-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)
suitable for rapid development.

It has a relatively small core language supported by many libraries.

Multiple programming styles are supported (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.)

Python is interpreted rather than compiled.

### Syntax and Design

One nice feature of Python is its elegant syntax --- we\'ll see many
examples later on.

Elegant code might sound superfluous but in fact it\'s highly beneficial
because it makes the syntax easy to read and easy to remember.

Remembering how to read from files, sort dictionaries and other such
routine tasks means that you don\'t need to break your flow in order to
hunt down correct syntax.

Closely related to elegant syntax is an elegant design.

Features like iterators, generators, decorators and list comprehensions
make Python highly expressive, allowing you to get more done with less
code.

[Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) improve
productivity by cutting down on bugs and syntax errors.

## Scientific Programming

Python has become one of the core languages of scientific computing.

It\'s either the dominant player or a major player in

-   [machine learning and data science](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
-   [astronomy](http://www.astropy.org/)
-   [artificial intelligence](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence)
-   [chemistry](http://chemlab.github.io/chemlab/)
-   [computational biology](http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page)
-   [meteorology](https://pypi.org/project/meteorology/)

Its popularity in economics is also beginning to rise.
