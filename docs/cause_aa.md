# Cause of Arctic Amplification

> Arctic Amplification is a prominent feature of global warming!

## What is Arctic Amplification (AA)?

- Near-surface of the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes are warming at rates double that of lower latitudes (Cohen et al., 2014).

## Why AA is important?

- Local impacts on human dimension
- Local impacts on nature system
- Remote impacts

## Quantitative definition of AA

- Arctic amplification factor (AAF): Arctic surface air temperature change divided by global surface air temperature change.
- Arctic amplification efficacy (AAE): AAF$_{XX}$ divided by AAF$_{CO_2}$, where $XX$ is the forcing agent.

## AA in Observational Records and Models

- Paleoclimate records
- Present-day observations
- General circulation model
- State-of-the-art climate model and future projection

## AA Structure

- AA has distinct seasonal and meridional structures.

## Physical Mechanisms Causing AA

### Climate Forcing

- We are here!

### Climate Feedbacks

### Poleward Energy Transport
